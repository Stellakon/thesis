% How I did it? First part of application by having the keplerian elements ....
% The implementation was done using Python and PostgreSQL (?)
%Print earth map. Based on the FOV and the revisit frequency, I can see how the Earth will be printed/colored (heat map). So, we want to track coverage/ revisit time across the equator.

% Tip: "Do not present data at this stage but use sketches or synthetic data instead"

% The app is used for analysis. It is not opeartional (obviously), so no need to check for mistakes in the import of the parameters.

% In the part of the database: mention that we focus on LEO and EO satellites!
