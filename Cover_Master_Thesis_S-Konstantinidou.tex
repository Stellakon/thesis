The motives of this thesis were the growing numbers of objects in space and the potential to exceed the carrying capacity in the near-Earth orbits. These are addressed by running a first experiment with the software written during this thesis, which can give the incentives to create space traffic management rules based on the orbit and capacity allocation, as well as the added value that each new satellite may have. An attempt to approach its development is to focus on Earth Observation (EO) satellites at LEO. Some capabilities of the software are the calculation of the revisit time of a single satellite or of a constellation at the equator or at a latitude of interest to the user, and the investigation of the orbital characteristics of a satellite in order to achieve a more frequent revisit time together with a group of satellites. Overall, those satellites, which can achieve a significant increase of the revisit rate, have a higher added value compared to other satellites/ mission, which do not come with any considerable changes. The creation of a database of EO satellites connected to the software increased the capabilities of the software, since a user can also find out whether there are operational satellites offering a specific service. For the development of the software, the necessary input data are the TLE set of the satellite, as well as the parameters related to the satellite’s EO sensor, such as the swath width, operational lifetime, spatial resolution and other. Having these parameters, the position of the sub-satellite’s points on Earth is found and based on the swath width the revisit time of the satellite is calculated. The experiments and results showed that higher revisit rates can be achieved when adding a satellite in the same orbital altitude and not placing it in a higher or lower one. Moreover, the addition of a single satellite to an already large constellation does not result in a significant reduction of the revisit time.

Keywords: revisit time, database, classification, added-value, Earth Observation satellites, LEO

\normalsize I would like to thank Dr. Vitali Braun for having included me in this exciting topic and for his thoughtful supervision. Despite this unprecedented and unstable period, his support was valuable, which kept my interest undimmed and his guidance is truly appreciated.

Additionally, I am also thankful to Prof. Urs Hugentobler for his help and his precious advice. The received feedback was always immediate and constructive.

Finally, my thoughts go to my family and friends, for their much appreciated affection and love.
