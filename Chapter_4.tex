% Another chapter is: EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS??

% -- Present your data and test area
% -- Indicate the parameters and setting you have used
% -- Show the results without judging them
% -- Present your evaluation method and its outcomeexample: accuracy assessment

% So, maybe another chapter will be for "Evaluation and Discussion" ??


%The discussion will consist of argumentation. In other words, you investigate a phenomenon from several different perspectives. To discuss means to question your findings, and to consider different interpretations. Here are a few examples of formulations that signal argumentation:
%
%On the one hand … and on the other …
%However …
%… it could also be argued that …
%… another possible explanation may be …

% In the evaluation part:
-- Judge your results critically
-- Compare your results with the results form other methods/works/experiments (keyword: validation)
-- show problems

- Strengths, limitations
- Importance of thesis contribution

% I will test the software with the big and well-known satellites, like Sentinel-1.
